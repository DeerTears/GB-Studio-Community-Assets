# How-To Contribute

## #1 Filenames

Make sure the file you're adding has a unique and distinctive name.
If you're using a common name ("cactus", "apple", "dance") put a number at the end of it so others may use the same name.

**Good filename examples:**

- "short_cactus_1.png"
- "short_cactus_2.png"
- "husky_howling.mod"
- "wolf_howl_1.mod"
- "jenna's_house.png"

**Bad filename examples:**

- "ascii.png"
- "plant27.png"
- "background2.png
- "template.mod"
- "mysong.mod"

## #2 Filetypes

No working files (.psd, .ai, .pdn, .gimp, .etc). Please only add .png images and .mod music files if you're submitting assets to be used. Don't make anybody else have to do the file-conversion process!

## #3 The Github Process

1. Have a Github account with all your files ready to be added

2. Make a fork of this repository

3. Upload your own files to your own fork (using the appropriate folders too)

4. Edit the README.md of the folder that has your new files to include the following formatting:

     **Your Name:**

      ``Your file`` - And a little blurb describing it

5. Make a pull request across forks. Make sure the page is showing `[my repository] <== [your fork]`

6. If you'd like to be added to the contributors list so you can approve your own pull requests or approve others', just let me know in your pull request. I'm happy to have more people contribute often.
