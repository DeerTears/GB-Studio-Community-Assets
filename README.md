If you use an asset from the repository, please read-up on who made the asset you've downloaded and pay it forward by including the asset-maker's name in your game's credits. :)

# Broken .mod Files Warning

There have been multiple reports of some .mod files being unreadible by OpenMPT and causing GB Studio to crash on build. This is being investigated. In the meantime, remember to save and backup your project folder, especially before adding new music. You can always test a .mod file using OpenMPT. If it won't play in OpenMPT first, it will crash GB Studio if you attempt to build with the .mod file in your project.

**Please report any bugged .mod files by name in the Issues tab!**
