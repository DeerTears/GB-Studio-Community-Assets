For all users to submit their own works. Must be original and usable in GB Studio. **Please do not upload content that you did not make.**

No attribution is required! All assets can be freely distributed and used commercially. If you're submitting your own work to this repo, you must be okay with it being used commercially and potentially redistributed without credit. Read the LICENCE file for more details.

**Downloading .mod music?** GB Studio will *claim* the music files are corrupted if you download the entire repository as a .zip (with the green download button). Github changes the line endings when compressing files, and this confuses GB Studio. You can fix this by:
- Opening the "corrupted" .mod file in OpenMPT and hitting Save.
- Downloading the individual .mod file you want from here: [https://github.com/DeerTears/GB-Studio-Community-Assets/tree/master/Music](https://github.com/DeerTears/GB-Studio-Community-Assets/tree/master/Music)
- Cloning this repository using a Git client like [https://desktop.github.com/](https://desktop.github.com/)
- Downloading the GBSCA mirror on Mediafire: (coming soon)

# How-To Credit

To help track our contributors, a README.md file exists for each folder. These README files contain the names of every asset creator, followed by a list of the assets they've made for that particular folder. If you use an asset from the repository, please read-up on who made the asset you've downloaded and pay it forward by including the asset-maker's name in your game's credits. :)
