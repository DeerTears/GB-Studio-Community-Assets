For all users to submit their own works! Must be original and usable in GB Studio. No attribution is required, all assets can be freely distributed and used commercially.  
### Please do not upload content that you did not make!

To find the creators associated with each file, there is a readme file for each main folder. **Example:** `/music`, `/tilesets`, `UI`, etc.  
Please take your time to read up on who made the assets you've decided to use, and consider including their name in your game's credits!

If you're submitting your own work, you must be okay with all of your submitted work being under the MIT Licence. That means your work may be used commercially or redistributed without credit. If you're submitting someone else's work, they must consent to have their work placed in a repository under the MIT Licence.

# How-To Contribute / Contribution Guidelines

Before submitting, make sure to give your files unique and distinctive names.  
Adding a unique name makes it *much* easier for users to browse the repository.

1. Have all your files ready to be added  
2. Make a fork of this repository  
3. Upload your own files to your own fork  
4. Edit the README.md of the folder that has your new files to include the following formatting:  

///  
**Your Name:**

`Your file` - And a little blurb describing it  
///

5. Make a pull request. Make sure the page is showing `[my repository] << [your fork]`  
6. If you'd like to be added to the contributors list so you can approve your own pull requests or approve others', just let me know in your pull request.

If you need help having your assets added to the repository, join the [GB Studio Discord](https://discord.gg/2hYeJ4m) and ask for Github help in the #code-review channel.
